Hello team! I'll add more info to this README shortly. We can use this place to add instructions on how to bring the application up once its checked in.


## Downloading Ruby & Rails
On a Mac:

1. Open up the terminal window (Finder -> Terminal)  
2. Install the latest Ruby on your machine  
` brew install ruby `  
3. Install Rails  
`sudo gem install rails`  
4. Restart the terminal window  
5. Try out interactive ruby by executing  
`irb`  


## Setting up the Project

You need to have git installed on your machine, then in the terminal window and in your desired directory:  
`git clone https://github.com/rashtar/cl0ud9-golf-tournament.git`

Once the project is checked out, you need to get the required project dependencies, execute the following inside the project directory:
`bundle install`

## Starting the application

1. In the directory where the project is cloned:
` rails server `

Ta-da! The applcation is up.
